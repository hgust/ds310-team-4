The goal of this project was to create a Modern Data Pipeline for COVID-19 data using Microsoft Azure and Power BI to extract, transform, load, and analyze our data. 
We cleaned and transformed our datain the Data Factory then uploaded it to Power BI for analysis. 
In Power BI, we calculated a 30 day rolling average for the number of cases and the number of deaths then used that metric to calculate the average growth rates of cases and deaths.
Then we created interactive visualizations to assist in our data analysis. 
Based on our statistical analysis, we determined the most unrestrictive policies (based on a scale of 0-4) that kept the growth rate of our data under 3% and the death rate under 1%.
